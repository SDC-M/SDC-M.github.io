      <p>
        Hello! I'm 21 years old and currently in my third year of studying
        Computer Science. I'm passionate about technology, programming, chess
        and running.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new languages, for example Go and TypeScript. After my
        first year at engineering school, I decided to join the University of
        Rouen. This allowed me to fully flourish. I now plan to obtain my
        bachelor's degree and then continue with a master's degree or a
        work-study program.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love building projects and exploring new areas like web development
        and algorithms. You can get a glimpse of what I'm doing here or on my
        Github I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and
        contribute to exciting tech communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't hesitate to contact me here if you want create something with me.
      </p>
      <p>Best regards - Sébastien</p>
